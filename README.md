# FDS1_Calc

To use statistics calculator, run the file using an IDE and input what is being asked. The calculator will let you know when your input is invalid and it will allow you to try again.
The calculator will accept lowercase and uppercase letters. And no worries if you accidently add an extra blank space, it should be able to accept the input anyway.
